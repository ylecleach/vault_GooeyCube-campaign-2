## 📖 Description

Target water vessel that you touch becomes ensorcelled, performing many of the basic sailors' tasks on its own. Ropes tie themselves off or loosen as needed, sails furl and unfurl as needed, the helm becomes easier to handle even during storms, and oars naturally fall into a good rhythm. The effect of this is that, for the duration, only half of the normal number of crew are required to operate the vessel. If you have a full complement of crew operating the vessel anyway, its speed is instead increased by 25%. In addition, as an action you can command the ropes to ensnare unwanted boarders; until the start of your next turn, all creatures that you designate treat the entire vessel as difficult terrain.
