## 📖 Description

Choose one melee weapon you can see within range as the target of this spell; the next time the target weapon is used to make an attack within the duration, the weapon briefly transforms into a viper, striking the creature wielding it. The attack against the original target automatically misses; instead, the wielder of the weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage, 1d6 points of poison damage, and becomes Poisoned for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect upon sentient weapons, and magical weapons cannot be chosen as a target for the spell unless it is cast using a slot of 4th level or higher.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional weapon you can see within range for each slot level above 1st.
