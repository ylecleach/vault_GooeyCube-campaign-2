**Blazing Blood**
Any creature that deals piercing or slashing damage to you in melee must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Failing causes them to be hit and ignited by your blood. They will take 2 fire damage each round for 5 rounds or until the fire is put out. The creature can attempt to pass the save and put out the fire at the beginning of their turn. This effect can only happen **once per combat** and only 3 times per long rest.
