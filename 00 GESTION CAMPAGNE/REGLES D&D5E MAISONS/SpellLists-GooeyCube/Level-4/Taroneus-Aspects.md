## 📖 Description

You cause a willing creature you touch to take on one set of bestial attributes, chosen from the list below. Any items being worn or carried by the affected body parts are absorbed for the duration of the spell.

• Aspect of the Ape: Coarse hair covers the target's limbs as their muscles ripple with fresh strength; they gain a climb speed of 40 ft.
• Aspect of the Badger: The target's hands transform into shovel-like paws with elongated claws; they gain a burrow speed of 30 ft., and in most forms of soil the tunnel created remains stable for the duration of the spell.
• Aspect of the Bat: The target's ears become covered in elaborate ridges and folds while growing to enormous proportions; they gain blindsight to a range of 60 ft.
• Aspect of the Bear: The target's hands become immense paws with wicked claws; they gain 2 claw weapon attacks, which deal 2d6 + STR modifier damage each, but they cannot hold anything in their hands, unless they have more than two arms.
• Aspect of the Dolphin: The target's legs fuse together and become a sleek and powerful tailfin; their speed becomes 5 ft., but they gain a swim speed of 60 ft. Note that this does not grant the ability to breathe water.
• Aspect of the Hawk: The target's arms transform into glorious wings; they gain a fly speed of 50 ft., but cannot hold anything in their hands, unless they have more than two arms.
• Aspect of the Horse: The target's legs become powerful hooved limbs; their speed is increased by an additional 20 ft.
• Aspect of the Owl: The target's eyes grow large, their mouth becomes a beak, and their face becomes enshrouded in feathers; they gain darkvision to a range of 120 ft.
• Aspect of the Wolf: The target's face elongates into a befanged snout; they gain a bite weapon attack that deals 1d10 + STR modifier damage, and can be made using a bonus action.
