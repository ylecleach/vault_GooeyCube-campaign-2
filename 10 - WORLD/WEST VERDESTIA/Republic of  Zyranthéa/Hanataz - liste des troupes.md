Voici la liste des troupes connues voyageant dans Verdestia.

* Blue Veil : Le Voile Bleu
* Red Wagons : les Wagons Rouges
* Yellow Lanterns: les Lanternes Jaunes 
* Night Song : Chant de la Nuit
* Bronze Bell : Cloche de Bronze
* Fools Dance : Danse des Fous

**_Note:_** As with the Red Wagons and Yellow Lanterns scrolls that Borag gave the party, the five scrolls in the tree’s hidden niche are encrypted and ensorcelled. They cannot be read by anyone other than the Bonduran of their intended troupe and, if a Comprehend Languages is cast upon them, they will burst into flames and be consumed in a flash. There are five scrolls for other troupes: Two for the Night Song, one for the Bronze Bell, one for the Red Wagons, and one for the Fool’s Dance.
