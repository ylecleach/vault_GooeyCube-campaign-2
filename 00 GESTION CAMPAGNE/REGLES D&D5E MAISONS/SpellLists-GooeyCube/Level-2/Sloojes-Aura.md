## 📖 Description

Choose a target point within range, or alternatively you can choose a target creature. You create a greenish-brown cloud in a 10 ft. radius sphere around the target; if the target is a creature, the cloud moves with them when they move. If you or a willing ally are the target, you make the requisite saving throws with advantage. A creature that begins its turn within the radius of the cloud, or enters it during their turn, must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, they become Poisoned until the start of their next turn. On a success, the creature becomes immune to the effects of this spell for 1 hour.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels

For every spell slot level above 2nd, the radius of the cloud is increased by 5 ft.
