## 📖 Description

The target creature you touch must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, choose one type of damage. The creature becomes vulnerable to the chosen type of damage. If the creature had resistance to the chosen type of damage, it loses that resistance for the duration of the spell instead. If the creature is immune to a damage type, that type cannot be selected for this spell.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a slot of 7th level or higher, the target creature becomes vulnerable to the chosen damage type even if it has resistance to it. Additionally, you can choose a damage type that the target has immunity against, in which case it loses its immunity for the duration of the spell instead.
