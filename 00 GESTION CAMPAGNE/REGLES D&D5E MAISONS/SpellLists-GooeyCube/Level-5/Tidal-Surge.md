## 📖 Description

A shimmering blue bead of arcane energy shoots forth from your hand to a point you can see within range. The 5 ft. space around the target point is unaffected, but all creatures within the remainder of the 20 ft. radius sphere around it are battered by a surging wave of water and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage, being knocked prone, and being pushed out of the radius on a failed save, or taking half as much damage and being pushed 5 ft. away from the target point on a success.
