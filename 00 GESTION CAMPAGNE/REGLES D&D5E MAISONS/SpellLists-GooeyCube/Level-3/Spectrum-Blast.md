## 📖 Description

A multicolored spray of energy erupts from your outstretched hands, wreaking multifaceted havoc on all before you. Each creature within the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 damage each of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, psychic, and thunder on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Roll the damage die for each damage type separately.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels
