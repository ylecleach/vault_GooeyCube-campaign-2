## 📖 Description

You conjure a bow of glittering golden light out of thin air; when you cast this spell, a magical longbow appears in your hand. If it leaves your hand for more than 1 round, it disappears and the spell ends. Each time you draw the bowstring, a magical arrow appears, ready to be loosed, and disappears after it strikes. You can use either your Dexterity or your spellcasting ability ability modifier when making attack and damage rolls with this longbow.
