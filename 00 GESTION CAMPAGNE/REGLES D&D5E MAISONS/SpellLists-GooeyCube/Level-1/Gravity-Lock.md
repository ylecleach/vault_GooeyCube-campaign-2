## 📖 Description

Touch an object of Medium size or smaller, which weighs 500 lbs. or less, that is not being held or worn by another creature. For the duration of the spell, the object cannot be moved by any creature other than you. The object will still move if acted upon by other forces, such as falling if dropped or being swept downstream in the current of a river. If you are holding the object, other creatures cannot pull it from your grasp by any means. If the object falls upon another creature, either it will fall to a space adjacent to the creature, or the creature will be forced to a space adjacent to the object, whichever is judged more appropriate by the GM. You can freely dismiss the spell at any time. The spell ends if you cast it again upon another object.
