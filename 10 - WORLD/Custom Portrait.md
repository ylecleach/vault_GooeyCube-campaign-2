### Character Notes

Born of Sarth noble parents living in Darkenhaven, which are one of the town's oldest Sarth family, the Valsan-Sool, renowned for their expertise in cutting and trading Flowstones. He was raised by his mother Astrene Valsan-Sool, a Sarth woman and a member of the Darkenhaven Council, in the noble quarter of Highgarden.  So, he was trained by the best Sarth flowstone cutters. His great strength and impulsive nature led him on the roads of adventure to combine his passion for flowstones with the adrenalin of adventure that was missing from his life.

After some years of lucratious adventures, he became the leader of an adventurer group named as the "Flowstone Seekers" which still operate in many large town of Verdestia, and are usually hired by rich patrons.

His lucrative but dangerous activities led him to withdraw from adventures and join the Adventurer's Fellowship, contributing his experience, his contacts and sometimes his patronage.
