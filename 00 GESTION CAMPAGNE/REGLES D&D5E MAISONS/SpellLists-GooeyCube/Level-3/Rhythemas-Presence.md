## 📖 Description

For the duration of this spell you gain advantage on all Charisma ability checks and saving throws. In addition, your spell save DC is increased by 2 for any spells that cause a creature to become charmed. Finally, if you cast a spell within the duration for which the target(s) become charmed, and would become aware that they had been charmed after the spell ends, they must instead succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when the spell ends to become aware that they had been charmed; on a failed save, they remain unaware.
