## 📖 Description

Roll 1d6 at the start of each of your turns for the duration to determine the spell's effects for the round. Some effects last for more than 1 round; these continue to apply for the listed duration, in addition to any additional effects in subsequent rounds. Reroll any duplicate effects within the same casting of the spell.

1. A 60 ft. cube centered around you is subject to the effects of the Faerie Fire spell; creatures are automatically outlined in light, as though they failed the saving throw. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

2. 1d6 creatures of your choice within 60 ft. of you, potentially including yourself, are subject to the effects of the Haste spell for 1 minute. During this time, the jingling of bells can be heard as the affected creatures move and act with great speed.

3. You create 6 glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within 120 ft., dealing 1d4+1 force damage each. As each dart lands the target becomes soaked as though splashed with a bucket of water. These darts are unaffected by the Shield spell.

4. Choose up to 6 living creatures within 30 ft. of you; each regains 3d8+6 hit points. The hair of each affected creature turns a vibrant shade of purple, green, pink, or blue for one hour.

5. You and 5 other creatures of your choice within 60 ft. start performing a comical dance. Affected creatures cannot move on their turn, and have disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. This lasts for 1d6 rounds.

6. You cast the Chain Lightning spell, which can affect up to 6 target creatures within 60 ft. of the first target. A blue and white jester hat appears on the head of each affected creature for 1 minute.
