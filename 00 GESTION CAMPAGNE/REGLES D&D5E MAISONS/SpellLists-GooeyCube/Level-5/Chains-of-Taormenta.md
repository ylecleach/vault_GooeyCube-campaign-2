## 📖 Description

Choose a target within range that you can see. Spiked chains materialize to ensnare their limbs; the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 3d8 necrotic damage and 3d8 piercing damage, and are restrained for the duration. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and are not restrained, and the spell ends. A creature restrained by this spell takes an additional 1d8 necrotic damage and 1d8 piercing damage at the start of each of their turns. As an action a restrained creature can make a Strength saving throw, escaping the chains and ending the spell on a success, but becoming frightened of you for 1d4 rounds. If the spell lasts for its full duration and the target is still restrained, they become frightened of you for 1 hour or until they can no longer see you.
