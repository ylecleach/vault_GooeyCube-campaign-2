## 📖 Description

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 20 ft. radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. You can see normally within the darkness, but other creatures cannot, even if they have darkvision or the ability to see in magical darkness, and no form of illumination, whether mundane or magical, illuminates it. If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
