## 📖 Description

You cause the ground to erupt with geysers of boiling water and steam. Choose a point within range; all creatures within a 10 ft. radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 fire damage and falling prone after being thrown into the air on a failed save, or taking half as much damage and not falling prone on a success.
