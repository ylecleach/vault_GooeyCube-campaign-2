* where is Stuckshoe on the map, which road is between Stuckshoes and main roads ? 

		Generally it is to the east of the King’s Crossing Causeway (the southern shore of Blackrot Bog there). We did not place it “exactly” so GMs can do that for their game.

* where is located Nuvea'dunadra on the Map, which entrances ? 

		This is the Dark Elven City but I am not certain it is fully decided exactly where it will be placed. It is definitely beneath West Verdestia… and I believe likely in the vicinity of the Wyrmrest Mountains… but I don’t believe we’ve picked the exact location. But the players should never get to that location (at least at this time).

* when will be produced some content for Nevermore ? the only info available are in Vol1 Encyclopedia Zyathica 

		In Chapter 6 of the tale… the party will return to the Nevermore area and, indeed, enter Nevermore. There will be maps of the town and other information that I think you will love.

* when will some contents be produced for Prondadal ? the only info available are in Vol1 Encyclopedia Zyathica 

		Prondadol may also be provided as part of Chapter 6… we are not certain of that as of yet though.

 * In the "massacre" of the Troupe, which of the following were using deadly poisons: dark elves, gnolls, human butcher family relations ?  

		It was the Dark Elves who were using the poison.

### Q&A du 08 aout 2025

Any target roadmap on chapter 6 ? 

Alphinius: it is being written and we have a goal of finishing Chapters 6 and 7 (together in a "mega-adventure") by June next year. There is more planning to do but we think we can make that happen. With you still having Chapter 5 to play (and potentially some side quest adventures such as the Witch's Wrath and Menace in the Mist) will that work in your timeframe ?


## deux questions à reformuler et envoyer

à quel niveau finisse les personnages de red star rising ? Lv 7 au chapitre 7 ?
