## 📖 Description

You create a distracting tune that disrupts the spells of other mages. All other spellcasters in the area must immediately make a Constitution saving throw to maintain any spells they are concentrating on, using your spell save DC. A creature that begins its turn within or enters the radius of the spell during their turn must repeat this saving throw.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can add 5 ft. to the radius affected by the spell for each spell slot level above 2nd.
