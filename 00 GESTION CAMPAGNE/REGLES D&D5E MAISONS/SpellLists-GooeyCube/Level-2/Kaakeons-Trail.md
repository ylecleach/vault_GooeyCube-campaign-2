## 📖 Description

Choose a location that you have seen before as the target of this spell. For as long as you maintain concentration, two sets of glowing paths will appear, visible only to you. The first will be marked by a series of golden shields, which denote the safest path from your current location to the target location; note that this does not indicate a perfectly safe path, but merely the path with the fewest hazards and dangers. The second path is marked with a series of red footprints, which denote the swiftest path between your current location and the target location. If there is a path that is both the fastest and safest, the red footprints will appear atop the golden shields.
