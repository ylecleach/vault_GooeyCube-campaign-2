## 📖 Description

You magically alter the wind in a 250 ft. radius around you for the duration of the spell. As an action while concentrating on the spell you can change the direction of the wind, and change its strength by one step up or down, as noted below. This change takes 1d4 x 5 minutes to take effect. The wind's starting strength when you cast the spell matches the natural wind around you, as determined by the GM. The wind will retain the same strength and direction for the duration unless you change it again. When the spell ends the winds within the affected area will return to their normal strength and direction over the course of 1d4 x 5 rounds.

Wind Strength: Calm, Moderate, Strong, Gale, Storm
