## 📖 Description

You unleash a blast of frigid cold; choose a point within range. All non-flowing water within a 20 ft. radius sphere of the point freezes solid, becoming difficult terrain. All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save they take 5d8 cold damage and their movement is halved; creatures that are moving by way of non-magical flight begin to fall to the ground, and cannot use their fly speed while affected. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and their movement is reduced by 5 ft. The reductions in movement last for 1d10 rounds.

## ⬆️ At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 5th.
