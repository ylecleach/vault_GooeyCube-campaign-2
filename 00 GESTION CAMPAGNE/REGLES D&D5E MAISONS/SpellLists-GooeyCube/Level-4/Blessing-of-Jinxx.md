## 📖 Description

For the duration of the spell, anytime the target must make a Dexterity saving throw that could result in taking damage or gaining a condition, they take no damage and do not gain any conditions, as hostile darts become flower petals, falling rocks become colorful bubbles, spikes become fluffy pillows, and so on, accompanied by a peal of distant laughter. This only applies to the target creature; other creatures that must make the same saving throw are affected as normal, and any objects like arrows or stones that were transformed by the spell immediately transform back to their original form once the target is out of harm's way. The spell also does not prevent any other effects due to failing or succeeding on the saving throw; if the target fails a Dexterity saving throw and would fall in a spiked pit as a result, they will still fall in the pit, they simply won't take any damage in doing so, for example. If the target of the spell is the caster, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, losing concentration on the spell on a failed save, each time the spell prevents damage.
